    "        2. Producers load data into Shards\n",
    "            - Can only produce 1MB per Shard OR 1,000 records/s per Shard (10 Shards $\\rightarrow$ 10MB/s OR 10,000 records/s)\n",

    "                    - Prevention:\n",
    "                        - Ensure you don't have a \"hot shard\" by choosing a good Record Key (Choosing a bad Record Key like device id (iphone, android, ...) such that 90% of devices are iphones and all iphone records go to a single shard)\n",
    "                    - Solution:\n",

    "                1. Kinesis Producer SDK\n",
    "                    - Write code to send data directly to Streams\n",
    "                    - **How?**\n",
    "                        - `PutRecord` (One record)\n",
    "                        - `PutRecords` (Multiple records)\n",
    "                            - Uses Batching and increases throughput $\\because$ less HTTP requests (Send many records as part of one HTTP request)\n",
    "                            - `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` if limit exceeded\n",
    "                    - Can be used on applications and mobile devices too\n",
    "                    - Use case:\n",
    "                        - low throughput\n",

    "                    - Managed AWS Sources that use the Producer SDK behind the scenes:\n",
    "                        - CloudWatch Logs\n",

    "                2. Kinesis Producer Library (KPL)\n",
    "                    - Write better code (C++ / Java) to get enhanced throughput to streams\n",
    "                    - Use Case:\n",
    "                        - high performance\n",
    "                        - long-running\n",
    "                    - Automated and configurable retry mechanism in case of `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`, while SDK has to deal with it yourself\n",
    "                    - Synchronous and Asynchronous API (Async performs better)\n",
    "                        - *KPL is the best way to send data asynchronously to Kinesis Data streams*\n",
    "                    - Submits metrics to CloudWatch for monitoring\n",
    "                        - Whenever you write application with KPL, you can monitor it directly in CloudWatch\n",
    "                    - Supports Batching\n",
    "                        - **How does it increase thoughput and decrease cost?**\n",
    "                            1. Collect Records and Write to multiple Shards in the same PutRecords API call \n",
    "                            2. Aggregate - Increased Latency\n",
    "                                - Capability to store multiple records in one record and go over 1,000 records/s limit\n",
    "                                - Increase payload size to improve throughput, maximizing 1MB/s limit\n",
    "                                - E.g. when we send a record of 2KB, KPL doesn't send it immediately. It waits and if another 40KB, and then 500KB record comes in, it'll then send it to maximize the 1MB limit / shard, hence aggregation. Once we have collected enough of these aggregated records, we can instead make a single `PutRecords` API call instead of multiple `PutRecord` API calls, hence collection.\n",
    "                                - We can control how long KPL waits to Batch these records via setting `RecordMaxBufferedTime` which is by default 100ms (This introduces more latency because you're fixing the wait times, but increasing your batching efficiency)\n",
    "                    - Compression must be implemented by user\n",
    "                    - KPL Records must be decoded with KCL / special helper library (KPL Records can't be read through CLI)\n",
    "                3. Kinesis Agent\n",
    "                    - A Linux program (Java-based agent) that is installed and runs on Linux-based server environments to get log file and send to Streams\n",
    "                    - Features:\n",
    "                        - Write from multiple directories and multiple streams\n",
    "                        - Routing based on directory / log file\n",
    "                        - Preprocess data before sending to streams (convert csv to json, ...)\n",
    "                        - Handles file rotation, checkpointing, retry upon failures, and emits metrics to CloudWatch because it uses the KPL Library\n",
    "                    - Use Case:\n",
    "                        - Aggregation of logs in mass in *almost* real timereal time\n",
    "                4. Use 3rd party libraries\n",
    "                    - Apache Spark\n",
    "                    - Kafka Connect\n",
    "                    - NiFi, etc...\n",
    "        3. Consumers read in data from Shards\n",
    "            - **What are Kinesis Consumers?**\n",
    "                1. Consumer Classic:\n",
    "                    - Records are polled by consumers from a shard\n",
    "                        - **What are Kinesis Consumer APIs?**\n",
    "                            1. Kinesis SDK\n",
    "                                - **How?**\n",
    "                                    - `GetRecords`\n",
    "                                        - 2MB/s at read per Shard across all consumers\n",
    "                                        - Returns up to 10MB of data per shard per call, but because limit is 2MB/s, it'll take 5s until you can make another `GetRecords` API call OR it'll return a maximum of 10,000 records per shard per call, meaning each record will need to be <1KB.\n",
    "                                        - Maximum of 5 `GetRecords` API calls/s per Shard across all consumers $\\rightarrow$ $\\frac{1}{5}$s = 200ms latency (200ms on average for each of the 5 consumers to access a single shard)\n",
    "                                            - If a call to GetRecords returns 10 MB, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw an exception.\n",
    "                                        - Because we can only read 2MB = 2000KB per Shard per second, if we have 5 consumers, they'll each receive < 400KB per second.\n",
    "                            2. Kinesis Client Library (KCL)\n",
    "                                - Java-first library but supports other languages too\n",
    "                                - Able to read KPL records (de-aggregating) which are specially encoded\n",
    "                                - Share multiple shards with multiple consumers in one \"group\" via Shard Discovery Mechanism (Streams can be consumed by multiple applications acting as a group)\n",
    "                                - Checkpointing feature \n",
    "                                    - Uses Amazon Dynamo DB table to checkpoint the progress over time and synchronize who's going to read which shard so that we can easily resume progress even when application is down (One row for each shard to consume from)\n",
    "                                    - $\\therefore$ we need to provision enough WCU (Write Capacity Units) and RCU (Read Capacity Units) or use On-demand Dynamo DB to make sure we have enough capacity for this feature.\n",
    "                                        - *If there is insufficient capacity, DynamoDB will throttle and slow down KCL because it can't checkpoint fast enough and hence cannot consume fast enough*\n",
    "                                    - Record Processors to process the data, making it convenient to treat messages one by one.\n",
    "                            3. Kinesis Connector Library (Soon Deprecated)\n",
    "                                - Older Java library, leverages KCL\n",
    "                                - Use Case:\n",
    "                                    - Write data to Amazon S3, DynamoDB, RedShift, ElasticSearch but Connector library must be running on an EC2 Instance that's sole purpose is to take data from streams and send to all these destinations\n",
    "                                        - We can also do this with Kinesis Firehose or AWS Lambda\n",
    "                            4. Use 3rd party libraries\n",
    "                                - Apache Spark\n",
    "                                - Kafka Connect\n",
    "                                - NiFi, etc...\n",
    "                            5. Kinesis Firehose\n",
    "                            6. AWS Lambda\n",
    "                                - Contains library to de-aggregate KPL Records, so can be used with KPL instead of KCL\n",
    "                                - Configurable batch size to set how much data at a time Lmabda should read from Kinesis which helps to regulate throughput\n",
    "                                - Use Case:\n",
    "                                    - Run lightweight ETL to Amazon S3, DynamoDB, RedShift, ElasticSearch\n",
    "                                    - Trigger notifications / send emails in real time\n",
    "                2. Consumer Enhanced Fan-Out:\n",
    "                    - 2MB/s at read per Shard per Enhanced Consumer\n",
    "                    - No API calls needed (push model)\n",
    "                    - Works with KCL 2.0 or AWS Lambda\n",
    "                    - Either KCL 2.0 or AWS Lambda subscribes to the shard and the shard would automatically push data at 2MB/s\n",
    "                        - $\\therefore$ 20 consumers will receive 40MB/s in total \n",
    "                        - With the normal SDK, we're only getting 2MB per second per shard, but now we have 2MB per second per shard per consumer, so we'll have reduced latency and increased ability to scale.\n",
    "                            - This is done by pushing data over HTTP/2\n",
    "                            - We get 70ms latency on average compared to 200ms with normal SDK\n",
    "                            - More expensive though\n",
    "                            - Default limit of 5 consumers using enhanced fan-out / data stream\n",
    "        4. Billing is per Shard\n",
    "            - Batching\n",
    "            - Per Record Calls\n",
    "        5. Number of Shards can evolve over time (reshard / merge)\n",
    "            - **What does each Shard contain?**\n",
    "                - Records that are ordered per shard (Ordered inside the shard based on when they're received)\n",
    "                - Each shard can support up to 5 API calls per second for reads, up to a maximum total data read rate of 2 MB per second and up to 1,000 records per second for writes, up to a maximum total data write rate of 1 MB per second (including partition keys).\n",
    "                - **What do Kinesis Streams Records contain?**\n",
    "                    1. Record / Partition Key\n",
    "                        - Groups records in Shards \n",
    "                        - Same Key = Same Shard\n",
    "                        - Uses a highly distributed key to avoid \"hot partition\" problem (All records does to the same shard)\n",
    "                    2. Sequence Number\n",
    "                        - Unique ID \n",
    "                            - Created by Kinesis after data has been injested\n",
    "                    3. Data Blob\n",
    "                        - Serialized as bytes, up to **1MB**\n",
    "    - As long as the data is still retained, we can reprocess / replay the data as many times by as many applications as we want from the same stream\n",
    "        - Real-time processing with scale of throughput\n",
    "        - A temporary database that is immutable\n",
    "        - Kinesis Resharding Operations:\n",
    "            - Add Shards, AKA Shard Splitting\n",
    "                - If we have a hot shard, we can split it into 2 so that instead of having a Stream capacity of 1MB/s per shard, we have double.\n",
    "            - Merge Shards\n",
    "                - Decrease Stream Capcity and save costs by grouping 2 shards with low traffic\n",
    "            - Auto Scaling\n",
    "                - Implement Auto-scaling with AWS Lambda to make API call to `UpdateShardCount`\n",
    "            - Limitations:\n",
    "                - Resharding cannot be done in parallel\n",
    "                - Can only perform one resharding operation at a time\n",
    "                - For 1,000 shards it'll take 8.3 hours to double\n",
    "        - Kinesis Security:\n",
    "            - Control access using IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies\n",
    "            - Encryption in flight using HTTPS endpoints\n",
    "            - Encryption at rest using KMS\n",
    "            - Client side encryption must be manually implemented\n",

    "    - here, no matter how many consumers you have, in enhanced fan out mode, each consumer will receive 2MB per second of throughput and have an average latency of 70ms\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "8. You would like to have data delivered in near real time to Amazon ElasticSearch, and the data delivery to be managed by AWS. What should you use?\n",
    "    - Kinesis Firehose\n",

    "    \n",
    "9. You are consuming from a Kinesis stream with 10 shards that receives on average 8 MB/s of data from various producers using the KPL. You are therefore using the KCL to consume these records, and observe through the CloudWatch metrics that the throughput is 2 MB/s, and therefore your application is lagging. What's the most likely root cause for this issue?\n",
    "    - Because it's under provisioned, checkpointing does not happen fast enough and results in a lower throughput for your KCL based application. Make sure to increase the RCU / WCU\n",

    "    \n",
    "10. You would like to increase the capacity of your Kinesis streams. What should you do?\n",
    "    - Split Shards, else implement your own auto-scaling with Lambda\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "11. Which of the following statement is wrong?\n",
    "    - Spark Streaming can read from Firehose (Firehose supports output to only 4 things ARES - Amazon S3 Redshift ElasticSearch Splunk)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "12. Which of the following Kinesis Data Firehose does not write to?\n",

    "    \n",
    "13. You are looking to decouple jobs and ensure data is deleted after being processes. Which technology would you choose?\n",
    "    - SQS\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "14. You are collecting data from IoT devices at scale and would like to forward that data into Kinesis Data Firehose. How should you proceed?\n",
    "    - Send data into an IoT topic and define a rule action\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "15. Which protocol is not supported by the IoT Device Gateway?\n",
    "    - FTP (MQTT, Websockets, HTTP are supported)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "16. You would like to control the target temperature of your room using an IoT thing thermostat. How can you change its state for target temperature even in the case it's temporarily offline?\n",
    "    - That's precisely the purposes of the device shadow, which gets synchronized with the device when it comes back online\n",

    "    \n",
    "17. You are looking to continuously replicate a MySQL database that's on premise to Aurora. Which service will allow you to do so securely?\n",
    "    - DMS is fully secure\n",

    "    \n",
    "18. You have setup Direct Connect on one location to ensure your traffic into AWS is going over a private network. You would like to setup a failover connection, that must be as reliable and as redundant as possible, as you cannot afford to be down for too long. What backup connection do you recommend?\n",
    "    - Site to Site VPN. Although this is not as private as another Direct Connect setup, it is definitely more reliable as it leverages the public web. It is the correct answer here\n",
