# Supervised Learning

For any machine learning problem, we have 2 phases. Firstly, we'll have to *Model* our data based on the questions of interest. For this, we can refer to ML models such as linear regression to model continuous data and logistic regression to model binary data (Note that each of the models could be derived from multiple perspectives like how Multiple Linear Regression has both a statistical perspective and geometric linear algebra perspective). In the next part, *Estimation*, we have statistical methods (Least Squares / Qudratic Programming, Linear Programming, Convex Optimization, ...) and probabilistic methods (Maximum likelihood Estimation - Frequentist, Maximum A Priori - Bayesian) to estimate the optimal parameters for the "best" model which will be defined.
