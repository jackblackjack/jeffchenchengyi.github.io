How much would you be willing to pay to rent an additional oven?\n",

    "    - For the 22 orders previously, we wasted 40 min in total waiting for the oven to finish baking the previous batch of cookies. Because the rate at which I prepare the cookie mix for my roomate to place into the oven far exceeds his / her process rate, if we had 2 ovens, and before optimizing the processes further with the two ovens, at minimumn, we have 40 min extra to process orders, increasing the minimum bound on our max order capacity from 22 to 26 orders per night. That translates to a minimum of USD 0.60 * 4 = USD 2.40 extra profit / night (again assuming infinite demand and no discounts given for orders about a dozen). Hence, with our unoptimized process, we'll be willing to pay USD 2.40 / night for renting the additional oven to break-even but satisfy more customers.\n",
