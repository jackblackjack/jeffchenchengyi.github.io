# Overview of Optimization Problem Types

After diving into the math about [SVMs](https://jeffchenchengyi.github.io/machine-learning/01-supervised-learning/classification/linear-support-vector-classifiers.html), I realized that the entire study of Optimization is massive, and we will give a top-level view of the landscape that is Optimization. We can distinguish optimization problem types using a few different perspectives:
1. Discrete Vs. Continuous
2. Unconstrained Vs. Constrained
3. None, One, or Multi-Objective
4. Deterministic Vs. Stochastic
5. Convex Vs. Non-convex
