## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Your goal is to predict the `total_cases` label for each (`city`, `year`, `weekofyear`) in the test set. There are two cities, San Juan and Iquitos, with test data for each city spanning 5 and 3 years respectively. You will make one submission that contains predictions for both cities. The data for each city have been concatenated along with a `city` column indicating the source: `sj` for San Juan and `iq` for Iquitos. The test set is a pure future hold-out, meaning the test data are sequential and non-overlapping with any of the training data. Throughout, missing values have been filled as `NaNs`. You can find the list of features [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/page/82/#features_list).
