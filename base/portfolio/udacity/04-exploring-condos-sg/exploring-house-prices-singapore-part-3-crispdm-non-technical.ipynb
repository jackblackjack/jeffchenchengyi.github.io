    "# Exploring Residential House Prices in Singapore\n",
    "By: Chengyi (Jeff) Chen\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be exploring housing prices and features in Singapore, trying to see whether we can derive any cool insights. As a preliminary to this project, we've performed all the ETL operations necessary - scraping Singapore Residential housing prices and their features from [99.co](https://www.99.co/singapore), a popular online marketplace for property in Singapore, cleaned the data by both manually and also imputing missing values using a nearest neighbours approach. \n",

    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: The data that we have gathered might be of pretty low \"resolution\". In our ETL pipelines, we've made a ton of assumptions when performing some of the manual cleaning. Moving forward, I'll probably find a better data source (or make one myself lol) because having interacted with 99.co's data, I've realized that though their data is quite structured, it lacks alot of key details that I might have been better off gathering from the official Urban Recreation Authority website of Singapore. But nonetheless, we'll just work with what we have now*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will explore the data we've scraped using the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, or CRISP-DM."

    "This is the first stage of the CRISP-DM process. In the context of Singapore residential housing, what questions would we like to address and along what type of insights do we want to gather from this dataset? \n",
    "\n",
    "A brief preliminary:\n",
    "- Singapore's residential real estate market contains both Public and Private Housing options. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Public Housing contains 2 main types, HDB Flats (subsidized and regulated by the Housing and Development Boards (hence HDB)) and Executive Condominiums that have facilities similar to that of private condominiums but cheaper. Private Housing contains Condominiums and Landed Property such as Bungalows. You can read more about the different housing types in Singapore [here](https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/a-general-guide-to-types-of-housing-in-singapore/). \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are several factors that affect the prices of Singapore houses that might be atypical from other places in the world. Factors such as how accessible schools / shopping malls / mrt (train station) are very important features that are factored into the  price of a house, on top of other things such as size. Condominiums and Landed Property around the primary shopping district in Singapore, Orchard Road, for example, are extremely expensive because of their accessibility. Hence, it'll be really nice to be able to quantify how much these features affect their prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are a multitude of other factors that affect the price of a property and whether a transaction will take place, these include features that can't directly be observed (data isn't that easily available) such as:\n",
    "    1. Interior design of the apartment\n",
    "    - View and Facing \n",
    "        - If a property is surrounded by a lot of other tall buildings, the price of lower floors will be much lower\n",
    "            - Hence, prices aren't directly proportional to the floor - more like a piecewise function - e.g. an apartment located on the 30th floor while all surrounding property developments are > 30 floors will have a comparatively lower price to the same property but on the 31st floor\n",
    "        - An apartment is facing prominent structures in Singapore such as the shopping mall, Marina Bay Sands, or places like Bukit Timah hill might call for a much higher price\n",
    "    - Size of the land plot of the property development\n",
    "        - The larger the size of the land that the property development owns, the more valuable it is as an investment opportunity, especially since Singapore is already so small\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Questions:\n",
    "1. Cluster Analysis - Currently, there are [28 designated districts](https://www.singaporeexpats.com/housing-in-singapore/singapore-district-guide.htm) in Singapore. After clustering our data, could we discern these 28 districts well, or is there a different clustering of the data?\n",
    "2. Feature Importance / Regression Analysis - Out of the physical features of the property we have gathered in our dataset, are there any that are most helpful in predicting the price of the house?\n",
    "3. Popularity - What are the \"hottest\" properties now, especially in the District 9, 10, 11 area (Primary Shopping district)?"

In multi-objective optimization problems, it's very rare to find a single most optimal solution for the problem. Instead, we'll find what is called a \"Pareto Optimal Set / Pareto-efficient Frontier\" which is a set of solutions that are not \"dominated\" by any others. \"Not Dominated\" intuitively meaning that a solution does not have any other solutions that are better than it in all objectives. Below, we have a written a function that does just this - determine the pareto frontier and plot it."

In simple terms, we just want clusterings that have individual sample silhouette scores that are more or less similar to everyone else's."

However, our clusters arent exactly like the ones in the 28 districts as virtually all the 27 clusters overlap various districts, not just a cluster for  each district. Although, the clusters do not seem too random and do appear to cluster some apartments quite logically. As you can see, Cluster 0 covers mostly Far East apartments, Clusters 1 and 8 covers mostly central apartments, Clusters 15 and  17 cover mostly North-west apartments, and Clusters 20 and 26 cover mostly Far-east / Far-north apartments. Cluster 9 covers mostly the Noth-east properties in District 19 and 28."

    "\n",
    "1. The clusters formed using features of each property development do not correspond exactly with the 28 designated districts in Singapore. However, they do encode some information about proximity as the clusters seem to form in nearby locations like how properties in the Far-East area will cluster together and properties in the Central area will cluster together. This means that properties nearby to each other do have more or less similar features, leading them to cluster together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The most important features for predicting a property listing's price is firstly the `sqft` and secondly, it's nearness to the primary shopping district in Singapore.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Within the primary shopping district in Singapore, `wilshire-residences` seems to have the largest land plot size, `ardmore-park` has the highest price per sqft, and `four-seasons-park` has the greatest standard deviation in previous transaction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are still far from exploring the data that we have to the fullest. I hope to continue this analysis by gathering more features specific to each property such as floor plan dimensions and using external economic indicators for house price prediction in the future."
