    "# AWS Lambda\n",
    "Serverless Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- A way to run code snippets in cloud\n",
    "    - Serverless $\\therefore$ No need to provision a bunch of EC2 servers to run the code\n",
    "        - Cost savings as you're only paying for the time you process and not when the EC2 servers are idle\n",
    "    - Continuous Scaling (Lambda automatically scales out hardware to as much needed depending on how much data goes into it)\n",
    "    - E.g. for our order history app previously, we can remove the EC2 instance that was helping us connect the Kinesis Data Streams / Firehose using the Kinesis Agent (Producer) to our consumers, DynamoDB / S3 Bucket to store logs and use AWS Lambda instead to do this, triggered by events.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- Real-time file processing\n",
    "- Real-time stream processing\n",
    "- Extract Transform Load Pipelines\n",
    "- Cron replacement\n",
    "- Process AWS events\n",
    "    - Lambda functions can be triggered by a variety of AWS sources\n",
    "        - E.g. When an object on S3 changes, it can trigger a lambda function \n",
    "        \n",
    "Lambda + Kinesis:\n",
    "- Your Lambda code receives an event with a batch of stream records\n",
    "    - You specify a batch size when setting up the trigger (up to 10,000 records)\n",
    "    - Too large a batch size can cause timeouts! (Max time before timeout is 900s)\n",
    "    - Batches may also be split beyond Lambda’s payload limit (6 MB)\n",
    "- Lambda will retry the batch until it succeeds or the data expires\n",
    "    - This can stall the shard if you don’t handle errors properly\n",
    "    - Use more shards to ensure processing isn’t totally held up by errors\n",
    "- Lambda processes shard data synchronously\n",
    "\n",
    "Promises:\n",
    "- Unlimited scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "Anti-patterns:\n",
    "- Long-running applications\n",
    "    - If you're performing heavy-duty processing, it's advised to port it over to an EC2 instance or chain lambda functions to work on different parts of the processing because we only have 900s per lambda function\n",
    "- Dynamic websites\n",
    "    - EC2 and CloudFront is a better choice for this\n",
    "- Stateful applications\n",
    "    - Because Lambda functions can't share any information with one another, you can store state information in DynamoDB or S3 to work around the stateless nature of lambda"
