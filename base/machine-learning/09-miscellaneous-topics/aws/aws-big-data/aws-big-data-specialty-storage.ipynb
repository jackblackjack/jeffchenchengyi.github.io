    "# Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS S3 Overview \n",
    "- Buckets\n",
    "    - Must define a globally unique name\n",
    "    - Defined at region level\n",
    "- Objects\n",
    "    - No concept of directories but UI can contain slashes to make it seem like theres a directory hierarchy\n",
    "    - Max size of object is 5TB\n",
    "    - Uploading more than 5GB should use \"multi-part upload\"\n",
    "- Consistency Model\n",
    "    - As soon as you write an object you can retrieve it unless you first make a `GET` request for the non-existent object, then `PUT` it, and then try to `GET` it again, but will eventually be consistent\n",
    "    - Eventual consistency for `DELETES` and `PUTS` of existing objects\n",
    "        - If read an object after updating we might get the old version\n",
    "        - If we delete object we might still be able to retrieve it for a short time\n",
    "- S3 Storage Tier\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/s3-storage-tier.png\" width=\"1000px\"></img>\n",
    "- S3 Lifecycle Rules\n",
    "    - Set of rules to move data between different tiers, to save storage cost\n",
    "    - Example: General Purpose => Infrequent Access => Glacier\n",
    "    - Transition actions: \n",
    "        - It defines when objects are transitioned to another storage class. Eg: We can choose to move objects to Standard IA class 60 days after you created them or can move to Glacier for archiving after 6 months\n",
    "    - Expiration actions: \n",
    "        - Helps to configure objects to expire after a certain time period. S3 deletes expired objects on our behalf Eg: Access log files can be set to delete after a specified period of time, Moving to Glacier is helpful for backup / long term retention / regulatory needs\n",
    "- S3 Versioning\n",
    "    - When a new object is added it'll get a version of null which will be overidden when the latest same object is added\n",
    "- S3 Cross-Region Replication\n",
    "    - Go to `Management > Replication` and add a new Rule to choose replicating data from one S3 Bucket into another in a different region so that team-mates in a different region can access it quick.\n",
    "    - The replication happens asynchronously.\n",
    "- S3 Entity Tag\n",
    "    - It is an MD5 Hash of the object stored in S3. You can verify that all your objects are the same if they have the exact same ETag.\n",
    "- S3 Performance\n",
    "    - Historically, randomizing prefixes for your object names help to better performance so that S3 can partition the best\n",
    "    - Recently, S3's request rate has increased and now requires no need to randomize object prefices to achive faster performance.\n",
    "    - For objects that are >5GB, use multipart upload\n",
    "        - Parallelizes `PUT`s for greater throughput\n",
    "        - Maximize netowrk bandwidth\n",
    "        - Decrease time to retry\n",
    "    - Use CloudFront to cache S3 objects around the world (improves  reads)\n",
    "    - S3 Transfer Acceleration (uses edge locations) – just need to change the endpoint you write to, not the code.\n",
    "    - If using SSE-KMS encryption, you may be limited to your AWS limits for KMS usage (~100s – 1000s downloads / uploads per second)\n",
    "- S3 Encryption\n",
    "    - Server Side Encryption (SSE) -S3: encrypts S3 objects using keys handled & managed by AWS\n",
    "    - SSE-KMS: leverage AWS Key Management Service to manage encryption keys\n",
    "    - SSE-C: when you want to manage your own encryption keys\n",
    "        - HTTPS must be used\n",
    "        - Encryption key must provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP request made\n",
    "    - Client Side Encryption \n",
    "        - Client is responsible for both  encrypting and decrypting objects\n",
    "- S3 Security\n",
    "    - S3 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\n",
    "        - If you request data from another website, you need to enable CORS\n",
    "        - Cross Origin Resource Sharing allows you to limit the number of websites that can request your files in S3 (and limit your costs)\n",
    "    - S3 Access Logs\n",
    "    - Security\n",
    "        - User based\n",
    "            - IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console\n",
    "        - Resource Based\n",
    "            - Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account\n",
    "            - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain\n",
    "            - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common\n",
    "- S3 Glacier\n",
    "    - Low cost object storage meant for archiving / backup\n",
    "    - Data is retained for the longer term (10s of years)\n",
    "    - Alternative to on-premise magnetic tape storage \n",
    "    - Average annual durability is 99.999999999%\n",
    "    - Cost per storage per month (0.004 / GB) + retrieval cost\n",
    "    - Each item in Glacier is called “Archive” (up to 40TB)\n",
    "    - Archives are stored in ”Vaults”\n",
    "    - Exam tip: archival from S3 after XXX days => use Glacier\n",
    "    - Vault Policies (similar to Bucket Policies that control who can have access)\n",
    "    - Vault Locks (Specify a rule that can never be changed for compliance and regulation purposes)\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS DynamoDB Overview \n",
    "- Primary Keys\n",
    "    - Can use only a partition key (HASH) or both partition key and sort key\n",
    "    - E.g. Out of movie_id, producer_name, leader_actor_name, movie_language, the movie_id would be the most suitable for a partition key because it has the highest cardinality\n",
    "- Common use cases include:\n",
    "    - Mobile apps\n",
    "    - Gaming\n",
    "    - Digital ad serving\n",
    "    - Live voting\n",
    "    - Audience interaction for live events\n",
    "    - Sensor networks\n",
    "    - Log ingestion\n",
    "    - Access control for web-based content\n",
    "    - Metadata storage for Amazon S3 objects\n",
    "    - E-commerce shopping carts\n",
    "    - Web session management\n",
    "- Anti Pattern (When DynamoDB is a bad choice)\n",
    "    - Prewritten application tied to a traditional relational database: use RDS instead\n",
    "    - Joins or complex transactions\n",
    "    - Binary Large Object (BLOB) data: store data in S3 & metadata in DynamoDB\n",
    "    - Large data with low I/O rate: use S3 instead\n",
    "    - Use DynamoDB when data is hot and you need to read from it consistently and fast\n",
    "- Provisioned Throughput\n",
    "    - RCU\n",
    "    - WCU\n",
    "- Can only query the partition key and sort key, cannot search by whether a feature = to a certain value\n",
    "    - Unless we define a Local Secondary Index but this must be done when table is created.\n",
    "    - We can also define a Global Secondary Index by going to `Indexes > Create Index`. This creates a new table but with a different primary key that you specify so that we have an alternative way of querying the table. We must define RCU and WCU for this though.\n",
    "- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)\n",
    "    - Solves hot partition key problem (too many reads on a single partition when a bad partition key is chosen)\n",
    "    - Use it if you have high read throughput and most reads are always the same in this case it's really nice because recent reads are cached.\n",
    "- DynamoDB Streams (Similar to Kinesis Streams)\n",
    "    - Used with Lambda to react to changes in table like when a new user is added, we can use this change to send a welcome email using lambda\n",
    "    - Can use the KCL to consume from this stream by adding a Kinesis Adapter library \n",
    "        - Alternative to using AWS Lambda\n",
    "- DynamoDB TTL (Time to Live)\n",
    "    - Service inside DyanmoDB\n",
    "    - Used to automatically delete items after their specified expiry data (maybe for regulation purposes like user data will be deleted after 7 days)\n",
    "    - Can recover deleted items within 24 hours from DynamoDB Streams\n",
    "        1. Create epoch number from date to expire item\n",
    "        2. Edit the item in DynamoDB with a new attribute of type number called `expire_on`\n",
    "        3. Go to `Overview` in console and click `Manage TTL` beside `Time to live attribute`\n",
    "        4. Type in which column to use for expiry, `expire_on`\n",
