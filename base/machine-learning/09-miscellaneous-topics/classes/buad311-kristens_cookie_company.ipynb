    "6. Are there any changes you can make in your production plans that will allow you to make better cookies or more cookies in less time or at lower cost? For example, is there a bottleneck operation in your production process that you can expand cheaply? What is the effect of adding another oven? How much would you be willing to pay to rent an additional oven?\n",

    "    - The bottleneck is the oven since the Roommate wastes 2 min between subsequent processing of orders\n",
    "    - Renting an additional oven would help us eliminate that 2 min wasted between subsequent orders waiting for the single oven to finish baking the cookies. \n",
    "    - For the 22 orders previously, we wasted 40 min in total waiting for the oven to finish baking the previous batch of cookies. Because the rate at which I prepare the cookie mix for my roomate to place into the oven far exceeds his / her process rate, if we had 2 ovens, and before optimizing the processes further with the two ovens, at minimumn, we have 40 min extra to process orders, increasing the minimum bound on our max order capacity from 22 to 26 orders per night. That translates to a minimum of USD 0.60 * 4 = USD 2.40 extra profit / night (again assuming infinite demand and no discounts given for orders about a dozen). Hence, with our unoptimized process, we'll be willing to pay USD 2.40 / night for renting the additional oven to break-even but satisfy more customers.\n",
    "    - Also, it might be good to hire someone else to help out with the roommate's section of the process, (along with this, buy more trays and electric mixers... However, all this really depends on the expected demand)."
