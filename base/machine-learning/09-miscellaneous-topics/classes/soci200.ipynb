    "# Research Paper #1 (15 points):  \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be a simple exploratory non-participant observational study in which you spend 1.5-2 hours in a social public environment and document the norms (cultural rules) of behavior that you observe.  You must draw on the relevant concepts about values, norms, culture, etc. from Chapter 3 in You May Ask Yourself (Conley) throughout the paper.   You can choose any public space where there are sufficient interactions happening to provide you with data.  Examples include dining halls; sports bars; salons; food court at a shopping center; the grocery store; coffee shops/houses; and many, many more.  Examples of norms include personal space norms; norms about waiting in line/waiting one’s turn; norms about speaking with strangers and appropriate topics of conversation and conversation length; etc. (Be creative!).  Just be sure you are not putting yourself or others in any danger or risk of distress by choosing an inappropriate space (e.g., don’t go to a child’s playground and hang out) or by engaging in agitating or risky behaviors.  Your task is simply to be there and observe without intruding into others’ interactions, space, etc.  You will write 3 pages total about the site you choose; the observation you conduct (e.g., What time of day was it? How crowded was it? How homogenous/heterogeneous was the crowd?); the norms you observe; the patterns you notice for potential future work; and your conclusions.  By norms, I simply mean what were the cultural rules that seemed to be in play? What did you actually observe that made you think that rule/those rules were in play (be very specific and descriptive)?  By patterns, I am referring to anything else that seemed to vary systematically with the presence or expression of the norm(s).  So for instance, if I notice that people tend to give a lot of physical space to other people in line (a norm), did that ever differ in any way, and if so, what, if any, factor seemed to be present when the norm/following the norm differed (e.g., Did children not give as much/any space as adults? Did the giving of space vary with how long the line was/how busy the place was?)? If any factor repeatedly corresponds with variation in the norm/presence or expression of the norm, that would be an example of a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your paper will include a clear identification and description of the site (see above paragraph), why you thought that would be a good choice for observing human interaction, the norms you observed, and specific behavioral examples that demonstrate the norms (so don’t just state vague or abstract norms, give clear behavioral examples that demonstrate the norm and explain how that behavior demonstrates that).  After these descriptions, you need to write at least one paragraph identifying some normative patterns you observed (see above paragraph) and listing some specific behaviors and patterns you would look for in a hypothetical follow-up observational study.  Finally, you will write at least one concluding paragraph in which you reflect on your observations and discuss the implications and your conclusions."
