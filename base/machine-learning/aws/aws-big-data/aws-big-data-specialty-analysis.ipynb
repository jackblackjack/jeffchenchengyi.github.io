    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- Streaming etl\n",

    "- Continuous Metric generation\n",
    "    - E.g. Building a live leaderboard for a mobile game by computing the top players every minute and sending that to DynamoDB or check traffic to website by calculating number of unique web site visitors every 5min and sending results to Redshift for further analysis\n",
